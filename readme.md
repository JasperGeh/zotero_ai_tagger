# Zotero AI Tagger

An intelligent tagging assistant for Zotero libraries that uses Claude AI to automatically generate and maintain consistent tags across your references. The script can process multiple content sources including abstracts, PDFs, and linked webpages to generate relevant tags for your library items.

## Features

- ü§ñ Uses Claude AI for intelligent tag generation
- üìö Maintains consistency with existing tags
- üìë Can process multiple content sources:
  - Document abstracts
  - PDF attachments
  - Linked URLs/webpages
  - Blog posts
- üìù Maintains a master list of tags
- üîÑ Preserves existing item tags
- üìä Detailed logging of all operations

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Zotero API key ([How to get one](https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys))
- Claude API key from Anthropic ([Get API key](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/getting-access-to-claude))
- For group libraries: Group Library ID (found in the URL when viewing the group)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zotero-ai-tagger.git
cd zotero-ai-tagger
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

1. Copy the template environment file to create your own:
```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

2. Edit the `.env` file with your configuration:
```ini
# Zotero configuration
ZOTERO_LIBRARY_ID="your_library_id"
ZOTERO_LIBRARY_TYPE="group"  # or "user"
ZOTERO_API_KEY="your_zotero_api_key"

# Anthropic API configuration
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key"
```

The `.env` file is excluded from git for security. Never commit your API keys!

## Usage

The script provides several command-line options to control its behavior:

```bash
python zotero_ai_tagger.py [-h] [-u] [-U] [-p] [-t TAGS_FILE] [-l LIMIT]

options:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
  -u, --url-fallback    Look up URL only when no PDF is attached
  -U, --url-always      Always look up URL content
  -p, --parse-pdf       Parse PDF attachments
  -t TAGS_FILE, --tags-file TAGS_FILE
                        Path to text file with existing tags (one per line)
  -l LIMIT, --limit LIMIT
                        Limit number of items to process
```

### Example Commands

1. Process everything (PDFs and URLs) with existing tags:
```bash
python zotero_ai_tagger.py -p -U -t tags.txt
```

2. Use PDFs primarily, fall back to URLs when no PDF exists:
```bash
python zotero_ai_tagger.py -p -u -t tags.txt
```

3. Test run with only URLs (no PDFs) and process just 5 items:
```bash
python zotero_ai_tagger.py -U -t tags.txt -l 5
```

### Tags File Format

The tags file should be a plain text file with one tag per line:
```text
LLM Jailbreaking
LLM Evals
Biosecurity
Unlearning
Protein Design
```

The script will:
- Load existing tags from this file
- Add any new tags generated during processing
- Keep the file sorted alphabetically
- Save updates after each new tag is generated

## Logging

The script logs all operations to both console and `zotero_tagger.log`. The log includes:
- Items being processed
- Content sources used
- Suggested and existing tags
- Any errors or warnings

Monitor the log in real-time:
```bash
tail -f zotero_tagger.log
```

## Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it
   - Make sure to update all required variables in `.env`
   - Use different API keys for development and production

2. **Start Small**
   - Do a test run with a small number of items first
   - Review the generated tags before processing your entire library

3. **Back Up Your Tags**
   ```bash
   cp tags.txt tags_backup.txt
   ```

4. **Monitor the Process**
   - Keep an eye on the log file
   - Check the first few items to ensure tags are being generated as expected

5. **Tag File Maintenance**
   - Review and clean up your tags file periodically
   - Remove any unwanted or duplicate tags
   - Keep backups of your tags file
